# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
# EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here, the final line).

STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

```
Nouns:

peep, message, time_created, user, username, email, password
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| peep                  | message, time_created, user_id
| user                  | username, email, password

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `peeps` 

    Column names: `message`, ``

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `user` 

    Column names: `name`

## 3. Decide the column types

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: peeps
id: SERIAL
user: text
message: text
time_created: datetime 

Table: users
id: SERIAL
username: text
email: text
password: text
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.


```

1. Can one user have many peeps? YES
2. Can one peep have many users? NO

-> Therefore,
-> A user HAS MANY peeps 
-> A peep BELONGS TO a user

-> Therefore, the foreign key is on the users table.
```

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 4. Write the SQL

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: chitter-challenge-html.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username text,
  email text,
  password text
);


-- Then the table with the foreign key second.

CREATE TABLE peeps (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  message text,
  date_created text,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  user_id int,
  constraint fk_users foreign key(user_id)
    references users(id)
    on delete cascade
);





```

## 5. Create the tables

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 chitter-challenge-html < chitter.sql
```
